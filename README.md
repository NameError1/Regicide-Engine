This is a text-based engine for Regicide that runs in the terminal.
**If you don't know how to play:**
1. Download the file (Python 3)
2. Open a terminal in the folder with the file.
3. Follow the in-game prompts to attack bosses, deal damage, and hope the Kings don't hit you for 20.

**_Rules_**
In the game, there are 12 bosses you have to defeat - 4 Jacks, 4 Queens and 4 Kings.
You attack bosses by playing cards - the cards' rank corresponds to how much damage you do.
The main gimmick of _Regicide_ is that different suits have different "suit powers".
So, every time you play a card, you activate that card's suit power (unless you play it against a boss with the same suit, in which case it's negated).
Suit powers:
Clubs double damage - so the 8 of Clubs does 16 damage
Spades reduces damage from the boss - so the 8 of Spades reduces damage taken by 8.
Diamonds refills your hand (up to a max size of 8) - this is the only time you can draw cards.
Hearts refills the draw pile from the discard pile - this is the only way the draw pile is refilled.

In later versions, I'll add the ability to play multiple cards, jokers, the ability to pick up dead bosses into your hand and maybe simple graphics.
